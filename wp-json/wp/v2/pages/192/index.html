However, there are times when events get accidentally deleted, causing frustration and confusion. In this article, we will discuss how you can find deleted events on Google Calendar in 2024.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Find Deleted Events<\/h2>\n<p>If you have accidentally deleted an event on Google Calendar, there are a few steps you can take to find it:<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Check the Trash<\/h3>\n<p>The first place to look for deleted events is the trash. Google Calendar has a trash folder where deleted events are stored for 30 days before they are permanently deleted. To check the trash, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<p>1. Open Google Calendar.<\/p>\n<p>2. Click on the three horizontal lines in the top left corner.<\/p>\n<p>3. Select &#8220;Trash&#8221; from the dropdown menu.<\/p>\n<p>4. Look for the deleted event in the list.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Search for the Event<\/h3>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t find the deleted event in the trash, you can try searching for it. Google Calendar has a search function that allows you to search for events by keyword, date, and other parameters. To search for a deleted event, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<p>1. Open Google Calendar.<\/p>\n<p>2. Click on the search bar at the top of the screen.<\/p>\n<p>3. Enter a keyword or date related to the deleted event.<\/p>\n<p>4. Press enter or click on the search button.<\/p>\n<p>5. Look for the deleted event in the search results.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Restore from a Backup<\/h3>\n<p>If you still can&#8217;t find the deleted event, you may need to restore it from a backup. Google Calendar allows you to export your calendar data as an ICS file, which you can use to restore deleted events. To restore a deleted event from a backup, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<p>1. Open Google Calendar.<\/p>\n<p>2. Click on the three horizontal lines in the top left corner.<\/p>\n<p>3. Select &#8220;Settings&#8221; from the dropdown menu.<\/p>\n<p>4. Click on &#8220;Import &amp; Export&#8221; in the left sidebar.<\/p>\n<p>5. Click on &#8220;Export&#8221; to download an ICS file of your calendar data.<\/p>\n<p>6. Open the ICS file in a text editor and search for the deleted event.<\/p>\n<p>7. Copy and paste the event back into Google Calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: Can I recover a deleted event after 30 days?<\/h3>\n<p>A: No, after 30 days, deleted events are permanently deleted from Google Calendar and cannot be recovered.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: Will restoring from a backup delete my current events?<\/h3>\n<p>A: No, restoring from a backup will not delete your current events. However, any events that were added after the backup was created will be lost.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: How can I prevent accidentally deleting events?<\/h3>\n<p>A: To prevent accidentally deleting events, you can enable the &#8220;Undo&#8221; feature in Google Calendar. This feature allows you to undo any changes made to events within a certain time frame. To enable the &#8220;Undo&#8221; feature, follow these steps:<\/p>\n<p>1. Open Google Calendar.<\/p>\n<p>2. Click on the three horizontal lines in the top left corner.<\/p>\n<p>3. Select &#8220;Settings&#8221; from the dropdown menu.<\/p>\n<p>4. Scroll down to the &#8220;Event settings&#8221; section.<\/p>\n<p>5. Check the box next to &#8220;Undo&#8221; and select a time frame for undoing changes.<\/p>\n<p>6. Click on &#8220;Save&#8221; to enable the &#8220;Undo&#8221; feature.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Accidentally deleting events on Google Calendar can be frustrating, but with the right steps, you can recover them. By checking the trash, searching for the event, or restoring from a backup, you can find deleted events and restore them to your calendar. Additionally, enabling the &#8220;Undo&#8221; feature can help prevent accidental deletions in the future. With these tips, you can stay on top of your schedule and never miss an important event.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Google Calendar Print Events Calendar Printables Free Templates\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/calendarinspirationdesign.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/recovering-deleted-events-from-google-calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>calendarinspirationdesign.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Google Calendar Now Lets You Restore Deleted Events\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.lifehacker.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/4\/2015\/11\/06\/1505771390856210467.gif?quality=80&amp;resize=1280,720\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.lifehacker.com.au<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Restore Deleted Events in Google Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/static1.makeuseofimages.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/google-calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.makeuseof.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Recover Deleted Google Calendar Events\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/d3s5n6bbhxr3im.cloudfront.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/htrdgce@2x-1024x602.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.cloudally.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2024 Calendar Templates and Images\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.vertex42.com\/calendars\/images\/2024-calendar-with-holidays.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.vertex42.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Google Workspace Updates Edit Calendar events directly from Gmail and Docs\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/1.bp.blogspot.com\/-_0UVWe8wk6M\/XuKk3nvcpOI\/AAAAAAAAI8E\/aAcjiCKgIDA_sWwqMDNH9YXphEkRTLIXACLcBGAsYHQ\/s1600\/Find%2Ba%2Btime%2Bside%2Bpanel.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Restore deleted events in Google Calendar Google Apps for NISD\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/sites.google.com\/a\/nisd.net\/google-apps\/_\/rsrc\/1454336081014\/tip-of-the-week\/restoredeletedeventsingooglecalendar\/Screen Shot 2016-02-01 at 8.10.48 AM.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>sites.google.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Restore, Find &amp; View Deleted Google Calendar Events\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.windowsdispatch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/How-to-Restore-Find-View-Deleted-Google-Calendar-Events.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.windowsdispatch.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>2024 Calendar Templates and Images from www.vertex42.com Introduction Google Calendar is one of the most popular calendar apps that people use to manage their schedules and events&#8230;. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/192"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=192"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/192\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=192"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
