With the ability to sync multiple calendars, you can easily share your schedule with others and stay on top of your commitments. In this article, we will show you how to sync Google Calendar with another Google Calendar in 2024.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 1: Create a New Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>The first step to syncing multiple Google Calendars is to create a new calendar. To do this, open Google Calendar and click on the &#8220;+&#8221; icon next to &#8220;Add a coworker&#8217;s calendar&#8221; on the left-hand side of the screen. Give your new calendar a name and select a color to help distinguish it from your other calendars.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Can I create multiple new calendars?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can create as many new calendars as you need. Each calendar can have its own color and settings, making it easy to keep track of different types of events or tasks.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 2: Share Your Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>Next, you need to share your new calendar with the person or people you want to sync it with. Click on the three dots next to your new calendar&#8217;s name and select &#8220;Settings and sharing&#8221;. Under the &#8220;Share with specific people&#8221; section, enter the email addresses of the people you want to share the calendar with and choose the level of access you want to give them.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: What is the difference between &#8220;Make changes and manage sharing&#8221; and &#8220;See all event details&#8221;?<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;Make changes and manage sharing&#8221; gives the person you are sharing the calendar with full access to add, edit, and delete events, as well as share the calendar with others. &#8220;See all event details&#8221; allows the person to view all the details of the events on the calendar, but they cannot make changes or manage sharing.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 3: Accept the Invitation<\/h2>\n<p>Once you have shared your calendar, the person you invited will receive an email invitation. They need to accept the invitation to start syncing the calendar with their own Google Calendar. Once they have accepted the invitation, they will be able to view and edit events on the shared calendar from their own Google Calendar account.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Can I revoke access to my shared calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can revoke access to your shared calendar at any time. Simply go to the calendar&#8217;s settings and click on the &#8220;X&#8221; next to the person&#8217;s name that you want to remove. They will no longer be able to view or edit events on the shared calendar.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 4: Syncing with Mobile Devices<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to sync your shared calendar with your mobile device, you need to make sure that you have the Google Calendar app installed. Open the app and go to &#8220;Settings&#8221;> &#8220;Add account&#8221;> &#8220;Google&#8221;. Enter the email address and password for your Google account and select the calendars you want to sync, including your shared calendar.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Can I sync my shared calendar with other calendar apps?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you can sync your shared calendar with other calendar apps that support Google Calendar, such as Outlook, Apple Calendar, and Thunderbird. Simply follow the instructions for adding a new calendar and enter your Google account information.<\/p>\n<h2>Step 5: Keeping Your Calendars in Sync<\/h2>\n<p>Once you have set up your shared calendar, it will automatically sync with your other Google Calendars whenever changes are made. This means that if you add, edit, or delete an event on your shared calendar, it will be reflected on your other calendars and the calendars of the people you have shared it with.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: What happens if there is a conflict between events on multiple calendars?<\/h3>\n<p>If there is a conflict between events on multiple calendars, Google Calendar will display a notification and allow you to choose which event to keep or merge them into one. This ensures that you never miss an important event or double-book yourself.<\/p>\n<p>By following these simple steps, you can easily sync your Google Calendar with another Google Calendar in 2024 and stay on top of your schedule. Whether you are collaborating with coworkers, planning a family vacation, or just keeping track of your own appointments, syncing multiple calendars is a great way to stay organized and save time.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Sync Google Calendar with Every Other Platform\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/static1.makeuseofimages.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/06\/google-calendar-sync.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.makeuseof.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Google Calendar Sync Download\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/images.sftcdn.net\/images\/t_app-cover-l,f_auto\/p\/b167ec26-96d7-11e6-96fc-00163ec9f5fa\/3688094626\/google-calendar-sync-3.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>google-calendar-sync.softonic.pl<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Setting Up Google Calendar Sync In Windows 8 With Outlook 2010 And 2013\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/miapple.me\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/04\/Google_Calendar_Sync-4.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>miapple.me<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Sync Your Google Calendar Appointments With Windows 8\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/static1.makeuseofimages.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/calendar-sync.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.makeuseof.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to Sync Your Google and Apple Calendars\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.lifewire.com\/thmb\/nCH0cB5oAnauuHf3i_39_CsnM30=\/774x0\/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()\/001_how-to-set-up-google-calendar-ical-sync-1172184-18d33090d62042c49ea93d0d11f4024d.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.lifewire.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How to sync Google Calendar with iPhone iGeeksBlog\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.igeeksblog.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/how-to-sync-google-calendar-with-iphone-and-ipad-1160x653.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.igeeksblog.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"How To Use Google Calendar Sync To Always Be On Top Of Events\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/mk0timetackleqyw86oi.kinstacdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/Google-Calendar-Sync.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.timetackle.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Sync Google Calendar, Contact, and Gmail with iPad\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.cravingtech.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2010\/06\/Sync-iPad-and-Google-Calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.cravingtech.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Setting Up Google Calendar Sync In Windows 8 With Outlook 2010 And 2013 from miapple.me Google Calendar is an essential tool for staying organized and keeping track&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/934"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=934"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/934\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=934"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
