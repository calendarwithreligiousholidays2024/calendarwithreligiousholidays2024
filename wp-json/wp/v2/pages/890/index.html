In this article, we will discuss how to change ownership of a Google Calendar in 2024. <\/p>\n<h2>Why Change Ownership?<\/h2>\n<p> There are various reasons why you may need to change the ownership of a Google Calendar. For example, if you are leaving a job or transferring to a different department, you may need to transfer your work calendar to your successor. Alternatively, you may have created a personal calendar for a group of friends or family members, but want to transfer ownership to someone else. <\/p>\n<h3>Step-by-Step Guide<\/h3>\n<p> Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide on how to change ownership of a Google Calendar in 2024: <\/p>\n<h4>Step 1: Log in to Google Calendar<\/h4>\n<p> First, log in to your Google Calendar account using your email address and password. <\/p>\n<h4>Step 2: Select the Calendar to Transfer<\/h4>\n<p> Next, select the calendar that you want to transfer ownership of from the left-hand column. <\/p>\n<h4>Step 3: Access Calendar Settings<\/h4>\n<p> In the top-right corner of the screen, click on the gear icon and select &#8220;Settings&#8221;. <\/p>\n<h4>Step 4: Click on &#8220;Calendar Sharing&#8221;<\/h4>\n<p> Click on &#8220;Calendar Sharing&#8221; from the left-hand column. <\/p>\n<h4>Step 5: Add the New Owner<\/h4>\n<p> Under &#8220;Share with specific people&#8221;, enter the email address of the person you want to transfer ownership to.

By following these step-by-step instructions, you can easily transfer ownership of a calendar to another user.
