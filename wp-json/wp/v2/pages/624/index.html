It was based on the lunar cycle, which is approximately 29.5 days, and the solar year, which is approximately 365.25 days. The Julian calendar was used for many centuries until it was replaced by the Gregorian calendar in 1582.<\/p>\n<h2>The Orthodox Church and the Julian Calendar<\/h2>\n<p>The Orthodox Church uses the Julian calendar to calculate the date of Easter. This is because the Julian calendar is based on the old Julian reckoning, which was used by the church in the early centuries of Christianity. The Julian calendar is also used by the Eastern Orthodox Church for other liturgical purposes, such as calculating the dates of feasts and fasts.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Why doesn&#8217;t the Orthodox Church use the Gregorian calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>The Orthodox Church does not use the Gregorian calendar because it was introduced by the Roman Catholic Church. The Orthodox Church sees itself as the true and original church and therefore does not want to adopt a calendar that was introduced by a different church.<\/p>\n<h2>The Impact of the Julian Calendar on the Orthodox Church<\/h2>\n<p>The use of the Julian calendar has resulted in the Orthodox Church celebrating Easter on a different date than the Western churches. This can sometimes cause confusion and inconvenience for Orthodox Christians who live in predominantly non-Orthodox countries. However, the Orthodox Church sees the use of the Julian calendar as an important part of its tradition and identity.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Does the use of the Julian calendar affect the Orthodox Church&#8217;s relations with other churches?<\/h3>\n<p>There have been some tensions between the Orthodox Church and other churches over the use of the Julian calendar. However, most churches have come to accept that the Orthodox Church has the right to use its own calendar and that this does not affect the basic tenets of the Christian faith.<\/p>\n<h2>The Future of the Julian Calendar in the Orthodox Church<\/h2>\n<p>There has been some debate within the Orthodox Church about the continued use of the Julian calendar. Some argue that it is outdated and that the church should adopt the Gregorian calendar in order to align itself with the rest of the world. Others argue that the Julian calendar is an important part of the church&#8217;s tradition and identity and should be preserved.<\/p>\n<h3>Question: Will the Orthodox Church ever switch to the Gregorian calendar?<\/h3>\n<p>It is uncertain whether the Orthodox Church will ever switch to the Gregorian calendar. While there are some who advocate for the change, there are many who believe that the Julian calendar is an important part of the church&#8217;s history and should be maintained.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The use of the Julian calendar by the Orthodox Church is a reflection of its history, tradition, and identity. While there have been some tensions with other churches over the use of this calendar, the Orthodox Church sees it as an important part of its heritage. Whether the church will ever switch to the Gregorian calendar remains to be seen, but for now it continues to use the Julian calendar to calculate the date of Easter and for other liturgical purposes.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Interesting Facts about the Eastern Orthodox Church Only One Hope\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/onlyonehope.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/The-Julian-Calendar.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>onlyonehope.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2021 Orthodox Julian Church Calendar Russian Tradition Etsy\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/i.etsystatic.com\/18670802\/r\/il\/a4e535\/3135790019\/il_fullxfull.3135790019_k9rn.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.etsy.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Orthodox New Year The Transition from Julian Calendar to Gregorian Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.myassignmentservices.com\/uploads\/featured-images\/2021\/01\/Orthodox-New-Year.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.myassignmentservices.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Handful of ancient, junior Orthodox Churches celebrate Christmas on\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.orthodoxianewsagency.gr\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/\u03b9\u03b5\u03c1-1-1024x683.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.orthodoxianewsagency.gr<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"On the Julian Calendar, Church Tradition, and Standing for the Faith\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/blog.obitel-minsk.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/1_5_1_2-3.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>blog.obitel-minsk.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Cost of Discipleship Orthodox Calendar 2011\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/4.bp.blogspot.com\/_5bo3n_N5QSQ\/TS0nLdmP5_I\/AAAAAAAAIJU\/-GaLxXrTG3U\/s1600\/card0001a.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>cost-of-discipleship.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Why the Polish Church returned to the Julian Calendar \/\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.pravoslavie.ru\/sas\/image\/102471\/247130.b.jpg?mtime=1473928311\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>orthochristian.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"The Revised Julian Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/c.tadst.com\/gfx\/1200x675\/american-orthodox-church.jpg?1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.timeanddate.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Revised Julian Calendar from www.timeanddate.com The History of the Julian Calendar The Julian calendar was introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE and was widely used&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/624"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=624"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/624\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=624"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
