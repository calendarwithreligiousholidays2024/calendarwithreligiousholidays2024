Here are some of the most popular methods: <\/p>\n<h3>Method 1: Use the Google Calendar App for Mac<\/h3>\n<p> One of the easiest ways to sync Google Calendar with Mac Calendar is to use the Google Calendar app for Mac. This app is available for free in the App Store and allows you to view and edit your Google Calendar events right from your Mac desktop. To use the Google Calendar app for Mac, simply download and install it from the App Store. Once installed, open the app and sign in with your Google account. Your Google Calendar events should now be synced with your Mac Calendar. <\/p>\n<h3>Method 2: Sync Google Calendar with Apple Calendar using CalDAV<\/h3>\n<p> If you prefer to use the built-in Apple Calendar app on your Mac, you can still sync it with Google Calendar using CalDAV. CalDAV is a standard protocol for calendar syncing that is supported by both Google and Apple. To sync Google Calendar with Apple Calendar using CalDAV, follow these steps: 1. Open Apple Calendar on your Mac 2. Go to &#8220;Calendar&#8221;> &#8220;Preferences&#8221;> &#8220;Accounts&#8221; 3. Click the &#8220;+&#8221; button to add a new account 4. Select &#8220;CalDAV&#8221; as the account type 5. Enter your Google account information and click &#8220;Create&#8221; 6. Your Google Calendar events should now be synced with your Apple Calendar <\/p>\n<h3>Method 3: Use a Third-Party App or Service<\/h3>\n<p> There are also many third-party apps and services available that can help you sync Google Calendar with Mac Calendar. Some popular options include: &#8211; Fantastical: a powerful calendar app for Mac and iOS that supports syncing with Google Calendar &#8211; BusyCal: a calendar app for Mac that supports syncing with Google Calendar and other services &#8211; SyncMate: a Mac app that allows you to sync your Google Calendar with Apple Calendar, as well as other data like contacts and notes <\/p>\n<h2>Q&#038;A<\/h2>\n<p> Here are some common questions people have about syncing Google Calendar with Mac Calendar: <\/p>\n<h3>Q: Can I sync multiple Google Calendars with Mac Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> Yes, you can sync multiple Google Calendars with Mac Calendar using any of the methods described above. Just make sure to add each calendar separately as a new account in Apple Calendar or the Google Calendar app for Mac. <\/p>\n<h3>Q: Will changes I make in one calendar automatically sync to the other?<\/h3>\n<p> Yes, changes you make in one calendar should automatically sync to the other calendar, as long as you are connected to the internet and the syncing is working properly. <\/p>\n<h3>Q: What if I don&#8217;t want all my Google Calendar events to show up in Mac Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> If you only want to see certain Google Calendar events in Mac Calendar, you can create a new calendar in Google Calendar and only add the events you want to sync to that calendar. Then, when you sync that calendar with Mac Calendar, only those events will show up. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> Syncing Google Calendar with Mac Calendar is easy and convenient, and can help you stay on top of your schedule no matter what device you&#8217;re using. Whether you prefer to use the Google Calendar app for Mac, sync with CalDAV, or use a third-party app or service, there are plenty of options available.
