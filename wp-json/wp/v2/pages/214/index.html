When you create an appointment slot, you can set the duration of the appointment, the number of slots available, and any other details you want to include.

Here&#8217;s how to do it: 1. Open Google Calendar and navigate to the day you want to create appointment slots for. 2. Click on the &#8220;Create&#8221; button and select &#8220;Appointment slots&#8221; from the dropdown menu. 3. Set the start and end times for your appointment slots, as well as the duration of each appointment. 4. Choose the number of slots you want to make available for each appointment time. 5. Add any additional details you want to include, such as a location or description. 6.

You can set reminders to notify you before the appointment starts, or even to remind you to prepare for the appointment ahead of time. &#8211; Customize your appointment slots: Take advantage of the customization options in Google Calendar to make your appointment slots stand out. You can add images, colors, and descriptions to your appointment slots to make them more appealing and informative. <\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<p> Q: Can I limit who can book appointments with me using appointment slots?
