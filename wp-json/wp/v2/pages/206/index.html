It&#8217;s important to dispose of yard waste properly to prevent it from polluting our environment. <\/p>\n<h3>When does Yard Waste Pickup Start?<\/h3>\n<p> The yard waste pickup season typically starts in April and ends in November. In 2024, the exact start and end dates will be announced closer to the season. <\/p>\n<h3>How often is Yard Waste Pickup?<\/h3>\n<p> Yard waste pickup is typically done every other week, but it may vary depending on the demand and the weather conditions. Check the Columbus yard waste pickup calendar for 2024 for specific dates. <\/p>\n<h3>What are the Rules for Yard Waste Pickup?<\/h3>\n<p> To ensure that your yard waste is picked up, follow these simple rules: &#8211; Place your yard waste in biodegradable paper bags or reusable containers. Do not use plastic bags. &#8211; Do not mix yard waste with regular trash or recycling. &#8211; Do not put rocks, dirt, or other non-organic materials in your yard waste. &#8211; Do not place your yard waste on the street or sidewalk. Keep it on your property near the curb. &#8211; Do not block the sidewalk or street with your yard waste. <\/p>\n<h3>What Happens to the Yard Waste?<\/h3>\n<p> After the yard waste is picked up, it&#8217;s taken to a composting facility where it&#8217;s turned into nutrient-rich soil that can be used for gardening and landscaping. <\/p>\n<h3>What If I Have More Yard Waste Than I Can Handle?<\/h3>\n<p> If you have more yard waste than you can handle, you can take it to one of the city&#8217;s yard waste drop-off sites.
