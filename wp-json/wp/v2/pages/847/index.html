It is celebrated to mark the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Easter is a movable feast, which means it does not have a fixed date. Instead, the date of Easter is determined by the lunar calendar. In this article, we will take a look at the Easter calendar for the next 10 years, from 2024 to 2033.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Easter Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The Easter Calendar is a list of dates that show when Easter will be celebrated in a particular year. The date of Easter is determined by a complex set of calculations based on the lunar calendar. Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon that occurs on or after the vernal equinox, which is around March 21.<\/p>\n<h3>Easter Calendar for the Next 10 Years: 2024 to 2033<\/h3>\n<p>Here is the Easter calendar for the next 10 years:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>2024: April 21<\/li>\n<li>2025: April 13<\/li>\n<li>2026: March 29<\/li>\n<li>2027: April 18<\/li>\n<li>2028: April 9<\/li>\n<li>2029: March 25<\/li>\n<li>2030: April 14<\/li>\n<li>2031: April 6<\/li>\n<li>2032: March 21<\/li>\n<li>2033: April 10<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Why is Easter a Moveable Feast?<\/h2>\n<p>Easter is a moveable feast because it is based on the lunar calendar.
