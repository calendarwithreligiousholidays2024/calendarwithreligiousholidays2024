In Texas, the Standard Possession Order (SPO) is a court-ordered schedule that outlines when each parent will have possession of the child. This order includes a visitation calendar that outlines the holidays for the upcoming year, which is essential for planning family events and vacations. <\/p>\n<h3>What is the Texas Standard Visitation Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> The Texas Standard Visitation Calendar is a schedule that outlines the holidays and periods of possession for non-custodial parents under the Standard Possession Order. This calendar is used to determine which parent will have possession of the child during certain holidays and breaks from school. <\/p>\n<h3>What are the holidays included in the Texas Standard Visitation Calendar?<\/h3>\n<p> The holidays included in the Texas Standard Visitation Calendar are New Year&#8217;s Day, Spring Break, Easter Weekend (from the time school is dismissed on Thursday until the time school resumes on Monday), Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving (from the time school is dismissed on Wednesday until the time school resumes on Monday), and Christmas Break (from the time school is dismissed for the Christmas holiday until the time school resumes for the spring semester). <\/p>\n<h2>Important Dates for 2024<\/h2>\n<p>In 2024, New Year&#8217;s Day falls on a Monday, which means the non-custodial parent will have possession from 6:00 PM on December 30th until 6:00 PM on January 2nd.<\/p>\n<p>Spring Break falls on the week of March 11th, which means the non-custodial parent will have possession from 6:00 PM on March 8th until 6:00 PM on March 15th.<\/p>\n<p>Easter Weekend falls on the weekend of April 19th, which means the non-custodial parent will have possession from 6:00 PM on April 18th until 6:00 PM on April 22nd.<\/p>\n<p>Memorial Day falls on May 27th, which means the non-custodial parent will have possession from 6:00 PM on May 24th until 6:00 PM on May 27th.<\/p>\n<p>Fourth of July falls on a Wednesday, which means the non-custodial parent will have possession from 6:00 PM on July 3rd until 6:00 PM on July 5th.<\/p>\n<p>Labor Day falls on September 2nd, which means the non-custodial parent will have possession from 6:00 PM on August 30th until 6:00 PM on September 2nd.<\/p>\n<p>Thanksgiving falls on November 28th, which means the non-custodial parent will have possession from 6:00 PM on November 27th until 6:00 PM on December 1st.<\/p>\n<p>Christmas Break starts on December 20th, which means the non-custodial parent will have possession from 6:00 PM on December 19th until 6:00 PM on December 29th.<\/p>\n<h2>FAQs<\/h2>\n<h3>What if I want to change the visitation schedule?<\/h3>\n<p> If both parents agree to a change in the visitation schedule, they can submit a written agreement to the court for approval. If the parents cannot agree, they will need to file a motion with the court and attend a hearing. <\/p>\n<h3>What if the holiday falls on a weekend?<\/h3>\n<p> If a holiday falls on a weekend, the non-custodial parent will have possession for the weekend according to the regular possession schedule, and the custodial parent will have possession for the actual holiday. <\/p>\n<h3>What if I want to take my child on vacation during my possession time?<\/h3>\n<p> If you want to take your child on vacation during your possession time, you will need to provide written notice to the other parent at least 45 days before the planned vacation. The notice should include the dates of the vacation, the destination, and contact information for where the child will be staying. If the other parent objects, you may need to file a motion with the court and attend a hearing. <\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p> The Texas Standard Visitation Calendar is an essential tool for co-parenting. Knowing the dates when each parent will have possession of the child can help both parents plan family events and vacations. If you have any questions or concerns about the visitation schedule, it&#8217;s best to consult with an experienced family law attorney. <\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2024 Standard Possession Order Calendar 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/standard-expanded-possession-order-calendar-in-texas-2022.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Child Visitation Calendar 2022 [Adjusted Calendar] Easton Calendar\" src=\"https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.custodyxchange.com\/images\/topics\/schedules\/50-50\/2-2-3-calendar.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>easton-calendar.blogspot.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2019 Standard Possession Order &amp; Parenting Time Family Law Pertaining\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/accalendar17.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/2019-standard-possession-order-parenting-time-family-law-pertaining-to-attorney-general-texas-calender.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>accalendar17.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"What is a standard possession order in Texas?\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.sanantoniobonds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2023PossessionSchedule-1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.sanantoniobonds.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"advent wall staples 2022 calendar Texas Custody Calendar 2022 print\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.sanantoniobonds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2021-HLF-Standard-Possession-Order-Calendar-1_page-0001-1.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>wallcalendar2022new.github.io<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Texas Child Possession &amp; Access Schedules TX Custody &amp; Visitation\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.custodyxchange.com\/screenshots\/states\/texas\/spo-holiday-schedule.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.custodyxchange.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"What is a Standard Visitation Schedule in 2020?\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.sanantoniobonds.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/2020-HLF-Standard-Possession-Order-Calendar-2-1-1300x1005.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.sanantoniobonds.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Texas Standard Possession Order for Parents and Children Family Law\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.busby-lee.com\/familylawblog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/CALENDER-01-2048x1836.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.busby-lee.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Texas Standard Possession Order for Parents and Children Family Law from www.busby-lee.com Introduction When it comes to co-parenting, one of the most important things to consider is&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/146"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=146"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/146\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=146"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
