The calendar for 2024 has recently been released, and it\u2019s important for anyone receiving benefits to take note of the dates outlined in it. In this article, we\u2019ll go through the calendar and answer some common questions about it.<\/p>\n<h2>What Dates Are Included in the Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The Social Security calendar for 2024 includes all the important dates that recipients of Social Security benefits need to know. This includes the dates when benefit payments will be made, as well as the dates when recipients need to submit certain documents or information to the SSA.<\/p>\n<h3>Benefit Payment Dates<\/h3>\n<p>One of the most important dates on the calendar is the date when benefit payments will be made. In 2024, these dates will be the same as they were in 2023: the second, third, or fourth Wednesday of every month, depending on the recipient\u2019s birth date.<\/p>\n<h3>Deadline Dates<\/h3>\n<p>The calendar for 2024 also includes several important deadline dates. These are the dates by which recipients need to submit certain documents or information to the SSA. For example, the deadline for filing taxes is April 15th, and the deadline for reporting a change of address is 10 days after the change occurs.<\/p>\n<h2>What Happens if You Miss a Deadline?<\/h2>\n<p>If you miss a deadline outlined in the Social Security calendar, it\u2019s important to take action as soon as possible. Depending on the situation, you may face penalties or a delay in receiving your benefits.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you miss the deadline for reporting a change of address, your benefit payments may be delayed or even suspended until the SSA has your correct address on file. If you miss the deadline for filing taxes, you may face penalties and interest charges on any taxes owed.<\/p>\n<h2>How Can You Access the Social Security Calendar?<\/h2>\n<p>The Social Security calendar for 2024 is available on the SSA\u2019s website. You can also request a paper copy of the calendar by calling the SSA\u2019s toll-free number at 1-800-772-1213.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The Social Security calendar for 2024 is an important resource for anyone receiving Social Security benefits. By taking note of the important dates outlined in the calendar and acting promptly if you miss a deadline, you can ensure that you continue to receive your benefits without interruption.<\/p>\n<h2>Question and Answer<\/h2>\n<h3>Q: Can I still receive benefits if I miss a deadline?<\/h3>\n<p>A: Yes, you can still receive benefits if you miss a deadline. However, depending on the situation, you may face penalties or a delay in receiving your benefits.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: What should I do if I miss a deadline?<\/h3>\n<p>A: If you miss a deadline outlined in the Social Security calendar, it\u2019s important to take action as soon as possible. Contact the SSA to find out what steps you need to take to rectify the situation.<\/p>\n<h3>Q: How often is the Social Security calendar updated?<\/h3>\n<p>A: The Social Security calendar is updated every year. It\u2019s important to check the calendar for the current year to ensure that you have the most up-to-date information.<\/p>\n<\/article>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<section>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Social Security Payment Schedule For December Calendar Template 2022\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.calendaron2017.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/ssi-social-security-benefits-payment-schedule-december-2019.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>calendaron2017.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Printable 2024 Calendar with Federal Holidays\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.wikidates.org\/calendar\/2024\/2024-calendar-template-02.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.wikidates.org<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"2024 Paid Calendar 2024 Calendar Printable\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/www.2024calendar.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/01\/social-security-2024-calendar-2024-calendar-printable.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.2024calendar.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Social Media Security Market 20202024 Increase in Hacks and Data\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/mms.businesswire.com\/media\/20200312005640\/en\/779405\/23\/IRTNTR30044.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>www.businesswire.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"July 2020 SSI Payment Calendar Social Security Benefits\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/socialsecurityportal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/The-July-2020-SSI-Payment-Calendar-1.png\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>socialsecurityportal.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Calendar For Social Security Payment Graphics Calendar Template 2022\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/nomadedigital.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/social-security-disability-benefit-payment-calendar-social-intended-for-calendar-for-social-security-payment.jpg\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>nomadedigital.net<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Social Security and SSI Payment Dates 2016 Direct Express Card Help\" src=\"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/directexpresshelp.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Social-Security-and-SSI-Payment-Dates-2016.png?resize=600%2C679&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>directexpresshelp.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<aside><img decoding=\"async\" alt=\"March 2020 SSI Payment Calendar Social Security Benefits\" src=\"https:\/\/i1.wp.com\/socialsecurityportal.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/March-2020-SSI-Payment-Schedule.png?fit=800%2C536&amp;ssl=1\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;\" \/><small>Source: <i>socialsecurityportal.com<\/i><\/small><\/aside>\n<\/section>\n<!--CusAds0-->\n<div style=\"font-size: 0px; height: 0px; line-height: 0px; margin: 0; padding: 0; clear: both;\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Printable 2024 Calendar with Federal Holidays from www.wikidates.org Introduction The Social Security Administration (SSA) releases a calendar every year that outlines important dates for recipients of Social&#8230; <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"footnotes":""},"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/826"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=826"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/826\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/w2.geleleger.nl\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=826"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
