The deductible is reset every calendar year, typically on January 1st.<\/p>\n<h2>How Does a Calendar Year Deductible Health Insurance Plan Work?<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a calendar year deductible health insurance plan with a $2,000 deductible. You get sick in February and go to the doctor, which costs $500. You will have to pay the full $500 out of pocket since you haven&#8217;t met your deductible yet. However, if you get sick again in June and go to the doctor, which costs $1,500, you will only have to pay $1,500 since you&#8217;ve already met your deductible for the year.<\/p>\n<h2>What are the Pros and Cons of Calendar Year Deductible Health Insurance?<\/h2>\n<h3>Pros:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lower monthly premiums<\/li>\n<li>Good for people who don&#8217;t expect to have many healthcare expenses in a year<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Cons:<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Higher out-of-pocket costs if you do have healthcare expenses<\/li>\n<li>Can be difficult to predict healthcare expenses for the year<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What Should You Consider Before Choosing a Calendar Year Deductible Health Insurance Plan?<\/h2>\n<p>Before choosing a calendar year deductible health insurance plan, you should consider how much healthcare you expect to need in the upcoming year. If you have a chronic condition or expect to have a major medical procedure, you may want to choose a plan with a lower deductible and higher monthly premiums. However, if you&#8217;re generally healthy and don&#8217;t expect to need much healthcare, a calendar year deductible health insurance plan may be a good option for you.<\/p>\n<h2>What Happens if You Don&#8217;t Meet Your Deductible by the End of the Year?<\/h2>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t meet your deductible by the end of the year, you will have to start over with a new deductible on January 1st. However, some plans have a rollover provision that allows you to roll over a portion of your unused deductible amount to the next year.<\/p>\n<h2>What are Some Tips for Managing Your Healthcare Costs with a Calendar Year Deductible Health Insurance Plan?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Shop around for healthcare services to find the best prices<\/li>\n<li>Use preventative care services to avoid more expensive healthcare costs later on<\/li>\n<li>Consider opening a health savings account (HSA) to help pay for healthcare expenses<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What Are Some Examples of Calendar Year Deductible Health Insurance Plans?<\/h2>\n<p>Some examples of calendar year deductible health insurance plans include Bronze, Silver, and Gold plans on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace.
